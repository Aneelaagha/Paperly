## ⚙️ How It Works

**Paperly** is a lightweight Chrome extension powered by **Gemini Nano**, Google’s on-device AI model integrated into the Chrome browser. It runs completely offline and securely inside your browser, without sending any data to external servers.

Once installed, Paperly injects a minimal script into webpages you visit, enabling the following functionality:

- 🔍 **Summarize** – Extracts the main ideas from long articles using Gemini Nano’s built-in summarization model
- ✍️ **Rewrite** – Transforms complex or academic text into clear, natural language using local AI prompts
- 🌐 **Translate** – Uses Chrome's native AI translation capabilities for quick and accurate language conversion
- 📚 **Cite** – Automatically formats selected content into proper citations (APA, MLA, or Chicago) using pre-defined local templates

All processing happens **locally in your browser** using Chrome’s built-in capabilities. This ensures:
- ✅ Full offline functionality
- ✅ Lightning-fast responses
- ✅ Zero data sharing — your content stays on your device

**Paperly does not require internet access, user sign-in, or any cloud-based APIs.** It’s optimized for students, writers, and researchers who need speed, clarity, and privacy — all in one place.
